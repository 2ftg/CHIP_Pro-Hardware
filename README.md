# Motivation

I wanted to muck around with the C.H.I.P Pro design.<br>
Also maybe use it as a starting point for the EOMA68-GR8 compute card. 

# C.H.I.P. Pro Hardware Versions

v1.0ftg C.H.I.P Pro, but in Altium<br>
v1.0 = C.H.I.P. Pro<br>
v0.9 = Early Pre-Cert Developer Kits

# Source Files
C.H.I.P. Pro is designed using OrCAD! 
And thus got converted to Altium by 2ftg. 
<br>A free "lite" viewer is available at www.orcad.com
<br>A free viewer for Altium files is available at www.altium.com/altium-designer-viewerw
